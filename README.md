## Description

This is a README generator. Using node.js and the inquirer npm package, the user will respond to a set of command line prompts. The app then generates markdown within a template, incorporating the user's responses and saving the resulting .md file. I developed this to practice and learn concepts related to node.js and working with npm packages.

## Installation

First, download the code. You'll need to initialize NPM and install the inquirer package as a dependency.

You'll need to install the following dependencies by entering this in your command line interface:
- npm i

## Usage

Once you've downloaded the code and installed the necessary npm dependency, navigate to the appropriate directory from your command line interface and enter "node index.js." Respond to the prompts to create markdown for your README.

## Credits

I'll put this in the old fashioned way.
